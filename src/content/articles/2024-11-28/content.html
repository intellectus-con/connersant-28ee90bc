<p>Financial markets are often described as mechanisms for price discovery—vast computational systems that aggregate information about economic value. But this description, while accurate, misses something essential. Markets are also meaning-making machines.</p>

<p>Every price is a story. Every trade is an argument. The numbers on the screen represent not just economic calculations but collective beliefs about the future, about risk, about what matters.</p>

<h2>The Narrative Layer</h2>

<p>Economists have long struggled with the disconnect between market behavior and rational models. Prices move on rumors, on sentiment, on narratives that have little connection to fundamental value.</p>

<p>But perhaps this isn't a bug—it's a feature. Markets don't just process information; they create shared understanding. They give us a common language to talk about uncertainty, a framework for coordinating expectations across millions of actors who will never meet.</p>

<h2>Implications for Investors</h2>

<p>Understanding markets as meaning-makers changes how we think about investment. Technical analysis isn't just pattern recognition; it's reading collective psychology. Value investing isn't just finding discrepancies; it's betting on convergence between story and reality.</p>

<p>The most successful investors aren't those who ignore narratives, but those who understand them while maintaining independence from them.</p>
