<p>
  Since humanity's earliest days, one rule has endured: the groups most willing to unite for war were often the ones
  remembered—and the ones who survived. Across cultures, the communities that endured were frequently those whose
  warriors proved the strongest.
</p>

<p>
  Among Europeans, the Mannerbund is a prominent example of this pattern. The term, German for "alliance of men," refers
  to the young warrior brotherhoods who lived and fought beyond the boundaries of ordinary society. While the details of
  these groups are difficult to reconstruct after millennia, scholars generally agree that Männerbund formations played
  a significant role during the vast Indo-European migrations.
</p>

<p>
  For Indo-European youths, participation in such a warband was a rite of passage. Not yet integrated into the settled
  life of their parents, they left the tribe with peers of the same age to train for war. They raided rival peoples,
  hunted game, and returned—if they returned at all—to recite heroic poetry of their exploits. Some never came back
  home, instead founding new villages and eventually new tribes among the conquered populations, often Anatolian farmers
  or hunter-gatherer groups. This pattern contributed to the migrations beginning around 5000 BC, during which
  Indo-European cultures displaced earlier peoples across Europe. Eventually the Pre-Indo-European tribes were
  annihilated, but the warband simply started fighting other tribes instead.
</p>

<p>
  Across Indo-European societies, the institution took different names. Among the Continental Celts, the concept was
  preserved in the disputed term kóryos, meaning "army" or "tribe." These warbands were instrumental during the Urnfield
  and Hallstatt periods, providing the manpower and mobility that fueled Celtic expansion.

<p>
  During the Bronze Age, such bands were central to Celtic society. Any account of Proto-Celtic culture or the diffusion
  of Celtic languages must acknowledge the influence of these mobile, youthful fighting groups. The final major Celtic
  migration occurred during the decline of the Hallstatt civilization in the region of modern Bavaria and Austria. From
  roughly 1300 to 800 BC, waves of warbands crossed into Britain. These migrants—later called the Insular Celts—became
  the last branch of Celtic culture to develop apart from the European mainland.

<p>
  One of the clearest survivals of the ancient Indo-European youth warband tradition appeared in Gaelic Ireland: the
  Fianna. The Fianna, or Fenians, consisted of young men who had left their families but lacked the land required to
  settle. Their exploits form one of the central bodies of Gaelic mythology, the Fenian Cycle, which recounts the deeds
  of the hero Fionn mac Cumhaill and his followers. Other notable leaders of Fianna bands appear throughout the cycle's
  tales.
</p>

<p>
  Historically, the Fianna operated as free-roaming warbands, raiding cattle and carrying out attacks on rival groups.
  They trained extensively in combat and were among the forces identified—alongside the Scoti—as raiders into Roman
  Britain during the empire's withdrawal.

<p>
  Remarkably, the Church tolerated the institution well into the 12th century, when it was gradually supplanted by the
  Norse-Gaelic Gallowglass mercenary tradition. Yet the cultural memory of stateless Irish warriors endured, later
  continued by Irish soldiers who served abroad in units such as the Irish Brigade (ASW) and the Irish Legion
  (Napoleonic).
</p>

<p>
  In the early modern era, the name was reinvoked as the <strong>Fenian Brotherhood</strong>, an early Irish republican
  movement named in honor of these ancient bands. "Fenian" soon became shorthand for Irish radicals more broadly. True
  to their namesakes, members of the Brotherhood even launched armed raids into Canada from the United States in the
  19th century.
</p>

<p>
  The Brotherhood's operations spanned Ireland, the United States, Canada, England, and Australia. Among their most
  notable escapades:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Fenian Rising:</strong> A failed rebellion led by Irish-American officers in Cork.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Fenian Assassination Circles:</strong> Covert groups that targeted British officials and later splintered
    into the Irish National Invincibles, responsible for the assassination of the Chief Secretary for Ireland. The
    aftermath included extensive betrayals and executions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The Catalpa Rescue:</strong> A dramatic escape of six Irish-American prisoners from a British penal colony
    in Western Australia. With inside assistance, the Brotherhood purchased the whaling ship <em>Catalpa</em>,
    positioned it in international waters, and ferried the escapees aboard before returning them to America.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Bombing Campaigns:</strong> The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), an English-based Fenian organization,
    carried out early bombing campaigns on the British mainland.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The Irish War of Independence:</strong> One of the Brotherhood's final contributions came through its
    involvement in the Irish struggle for independence. Michael Collins served as president of the IRB Supreme Council.
    After his death, the organization dissolved and its members joined successor movements.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now to conclude, an argument could be made that the Irish Republican Army represented a continuation of the ancient
  <em>kóryos</em> tradition. Many violent impulses in European history can be traced to similar warband structures—the
  primal urge toward conquest and battle. Examples across the continent are too numerous to list, from the Vikingr and
  Uskoks to the Conquistadors and Freikorps.
</p>

<p>Focusing on the Gaelic Irish lineage, the IRA shared core traits with these earlier bands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They were composed of youth who believed their society was ineffectual.</li>
  <li>They left ordinary life to train for war in rural camps with like-minded peers.</li>
  <li>They conducted guerrilla raids against the enemy, such as the Black and Tans.</li>
  <li>
    They acted in the belief that violent struggle was necessary to secure or expand the rightful borders of Ireland.
  </li>
</ul>
