<p>We live in an attention economy, but we build environments for a different species. Our offices, our devices, our cities—all designed as if human attention were infinite, unflagging, mechanically reliable.</p>

<p>The mismatch between our cognitive architecture and our built environment creates friction we've learned to ignore. We adapt to interruption, normalize distraction, mistake busyness for productivity.</p>

<h2>Designing for Focus</h2>

<p>What would our environments look like if designed around attention's true nature? The answer involves both addition and subtraction.</p>

<p>Addition: cues that direct focus, transitions that signal context switches, spaces that support deep work.</p>

<p>Subtraction: the elimination of unnecessary choices, the reduction of ambient interruption, the removal of friction from meaningful tasks.</p>

<h2>The Personal Architecture</h2>

<p>Beyond physical space, we each construct personal architectures of attention through habit, routine, and tool selection. These architectures can be intentional or accidental, supportive or sabotaging.</p>

<p>The most productive people are often those who have thought carefully about their attention architecture—who treat focus not as willpower but as design.</p>
